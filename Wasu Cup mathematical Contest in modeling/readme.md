## HuaShu Cup 2023 B Question: Optimal Color Scheme Design for Opaque Products

### Introduction
In daily life, colorful opaque products are achieved through pigmentation. The coloration of these products significantly impacts their aesthetic appeal and market competitiveness. However, traditional manual color matching has limitations such as subjectivity and inefficiency. Thus, studying computer-aided color matching for opaque products is crucial.

### Background
Light interacts with objects through absorption, reflection, and transmission. For opaque products, most light is absorbed or reflected. The reflected light, after correction for transparency, is decomposed into different color components to form a spectrogram. For simplification, the reflectivity of the final color after matching is represented by spectral data at 20 nm intervals within the 400-700 nm wavelength range.

The relationship between the ratio of absorption coefficient (K) to scattering coefficient (S) and reflectivity (R) of opaque materials is based on the Kubelka-Munk (K-M) optical model, as detailed in Reference [1].

### Objectives
The objectives of this competition are:

1. **Calculate K/S-Concentration Relationship**: Compute the relationship between K/S and concentration for the three pigments (red, yellow, blue) at various wavelengths.

2. **Establish Color Matching Optimization Model**: Based on given R values and the K/S database, develop an optimization model to formulate color matches with a color difference of less than 1.

3. **Cost and Batch Color Matching**: Extend the model to consider cost control and batch color matching for a 2 kg substrate.

4. **Minimize Pigment Usage**: Identify optimal color schemes for the first 5 samples, requiring minimal pigments and ensuring color differences are less than 1.

### Key Concepts
- **Kubelka-Munk Model**: Describes the relationship between K/S ratio and reflectivity for opaque materials.
- **Color Difference (Î”E)**: Quantifies the difference between two colors, using CIELAB color space for calculation.

### Questions

#### Problem 1: K/S-Concentration Relationship
For each pigment (red, yellow, blue) and wavelength (from 400 nm to 700 nm in 20 nm increments), calculate the relationship between K/S and concentration, and provide the functional relationship and fitting coefficients.

#### Problem 2: Color Matching Optimization Model
Develop an optimization model that, given the R values of target samples and the K/S database, formulates color matches with a color difference of less than 1.

#### Problem 3: Cost and Batch Color Matching
Extend the model to incorporate cost control and batch color matching for 2 kg substrates, ensuring color differences remain below 1.

#### Problem 4: Minimize Pigment Usage
Optimize the color matching schemes for the first 5 target samples, requiring minimal pigments and maintaining color differences less than 1, generating 5 distinct formulations per sample.

### Conclusion
This problem aims to revolutionize the color matching process for opaque products by leveraging computer-aided methods, addressing inefficiencies and subjectivity in traditional manual approaches. The solutions will not only improve product aesthetics but also enhance market competitiveness and reduce production costs.
