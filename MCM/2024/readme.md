**0.1 Background of the Problem**

Based on the actual conditions in rural areas, it is of great practical significance for the sustainable development of the rural economy to fully utilize limited farmland resources and develop the organic farming industry according to local conditions. Selecting suitable crops and optimizing planting strategies can facilitate field management, improve production efficiency, and reduce planting risks that may arise from various uncertainties. A certain village is located in the mountainous region of North China, where the temperature is relatively low throughout the year, and most farmland can only be used to grow one crop per year. The village currently has 1,201 acres of open farmland, distributed across 34 plots of varying sizes, including flat dry land, terraced fields, hillside land, and irrigated land. Flat dry land, terraced fields, and hillside land are suitable for planting one crop per year; irrigated land is suitable for planting one crop of rice or two crops of vegetables per year. Additionally, the village has 16 ordinary greenhouses and 4 smart greenhouses, each with a cultivated area of 0.6 acres. Ordinary greenhouses are suitable for planting one crop of vegetables and one crop of edible mushrooms per year, while smart greenhouses are suitable for planting two crops of vegetables per year. Different crops can be planted together in the same plot (including greenhouses) each season. See Attachment 1 for details. According to the growth patterns of crops, each type of crop cannot be planted consecutively in the same plot (including greenhouses) as it will lead to reduced yields; however, soil containing bean crop rhizobia is beneficial for the growth of other crops, so from 2023 onwards, it is required that all land in each plot (including greenhouses) must be planted with bean crops at least once within three years. Meanwhile, the planting plan should consider convenient farming operations and field management, such as not planting each crop too dispersedly each season and not planting each crop on too small an area in a single plot (including greenhouses). The crop planting and related statistical data for 2023 are provided in Attachment 2.

**0.2 Requirements of the Problem**

Assuming that the future expected sales volume, planting costs, yield per acre, and sales prices of various crops remain stable compared to 2023, and that the crops planted each season are sold within that season. If the total production of a certain crop per season exceeds the corresponding expected sales volume, the excess portion cannot be sold normally. Please provide the optimal crop planting plans for the village from 2024 to 2030 for the following two scenarios, and fill in the results in result11.xlsx and result12.xlsx respectively (see Attachment 3 for the template files).
