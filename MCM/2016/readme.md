The transmission nodes of the nearshore and offshore observation network consist of a buoy system, a mooring system, and an underwater acoustic communication system (as shown in Figure 1). The buoy system of a certain type of transmission node can be simplified as a cylinder with a base diameter of 2m and a height of 2m, and the mass of the buoy is 1000kg. The mooring system comprises steel pipes, a steel cylinder, a heavy ball,电焊 anchor chains, and specially designed drag-resistant anchors. The mass of the anchor is 600kg, and the anchor chain employs undivided ordinary links. Common models and their parameters for nearshore and offshore observation networks are listed in the attached table. There are a total of 4 sections of steel pipes, each with a length of 1m, a diameter of 50mm, and a mass of 10kg per section. It is required that the tangent direction at the connection between the end of the anchor chain and the anchor shall not exceed an angle of 16 degrees with the seabed; otherwise, the anchor will be dragged, causing the node to shift and be lost. The underwater acoustic communication system is installed in a sealed cylindrical steel cylinder with a length of 1m and an outer diameter of 30cm. The total mass of the equipment and the steel cylinder is 100kg. The steel cylinder is connected to the fourth section of steel pipe above and to the电焊 anchor chain below. When the steel cylinder is vertical, the underwater acoustic communication equipment operates most effectively. If the steel cylinder is tilted, it will affect the equipment's operating effectiveness. When the tilt angle of the steel cylinder (the angle between the steel cylinder and the vertical line) exceeds 5 degrees, the equipment's operating effectiveness is poor. To control the tilt angle of the steel cylinder, a heavy ball can be suspended at the connection between the steel cylinder and the电焊 anchor chain.

The design problem of the mooring system involves determining the type and length of the anchor chain and the mass of the heavy ball to minimize the submergence depth and movement area of the buoy and the tilt angle of the steel cylinder.

**Problem 1**: A certain type of transmission node uses Type II电焊 anchor chains with a length of 22.05m and a selected heavy ball with a mass of 1200kg. This type of transmission node is deployed in a sea area with a water depth of 18m, a flat seabed, and a seawater density of 1.025×10^3 kg/m^3. Assuming still seawater, calculate the tilt angles of the steel cylinder and each section of steel pipe, the shape of the anchor chain, the submergence depth of the buoy, and the movement area when the wind speeds at the sea surface are 12m/s and 24m/s.

**Problem 2**: Under the assumptions of Problem 1, calculate the tilt angles of the steel cylinder and each section of steel pipe, the shape of the anchor chain, and the movement area of the buoy when the wind speed at the sea surface is 36m/s. Adjust the mass of the heavy ball so that the tilt angle of the steel cylinder does not exceed 5 degrees and the angle between the anchor chain and the seabed at the anchor point does not exceed 16 degrees.

**Problem 3**: Due to factors such as tides, the measured water depth in the deployment area ranges between 16m and 20m. The maximum seawater velocity at the deployment point can reach 1.5m/s, and the maximum wind speed can reach 36m/s. Provide a design for the mooring system considering wind force, current force, and water depth, and analyze the tilt angles of the steel cylinder and steel pipes, the shape of the anchor chain, the submergence depth of the buoy, and the movement area under different conditions.

**Note**: The nearshore wind load can be calculated using the approximate formula F = 0.625 × S × v^2 (N), where S is the projected area of the object in the plane perpendicular to the wind direction (m^2), and v is the wind speed (m/s). The nearshore current force can be calculated using the approximate formula F = 374 × S × v^2 (N), where S is the projected area of the
